					IFC recognized fraternities at Virginia Tech have a formal recruitment period once every semester which lasts about two weeks. 
					We, at Zeta Psi, use this time to host several events such as poker night, bowling, pickup basketball, Sharkeyâ€™s Wing Night,
					bonfires, hiking the Cascades, and trips to the shooting range in order to get to know our potential candidates as well as
					giving them a chance to learn about our chapter.
