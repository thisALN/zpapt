				Zeta Psi strives to be the premier international men&#39;s fraternal organization dedicated to forging academic excellence. We take school seriously and look to 
				provide an environment that fosters the ability to exceed in academic life. We consistently score in the top 3 of IFC recognized fraternities for new member 
				GPAs here at Virginia Tech. With a wide range of majors represented at the Alpha Pi chapter, brothers have the unique ability to seek help with their 
				academics from within the fraternity.<br><br>

			Each year the Alpha Pi alumni  give out two $500 scholarships to active brothers in the chapter for academics and community involvement. Brothers can also
			apply to the scholarships given out from our national organization provided by The Zeta Psi Educational Foundation which awards about 75 scholarships each
			semester to eligible students in the United States. More information on this scholarship can be found by following this link:

			The Alpha Pi chapter also participates in regional Leadership Training Institutes (LTIs) which are designed to teach leadership skills across a broad range of 
			topics from "how to create and manage successful fraternity chapters" to "how to prepare our members for success in life and their careers after college". 
			To learn more about LTIs please follow this link: <a href = "http://zetapsi.org/lti/">http://zetapsi.org/lti/</a><br><br>

			Another program run by our national organization is the Washington Scholars Fellowship Program which places public policy oriented individuals in premier
			internships throughout government agencies, media outlets and non-governmental organizations. These positions offer a unique look at Washington D.C. 
			from the insider-out perspective and provides a hands-on point of view to their interns. The time spent in Washington D.C. provides interns with valuable 
			knowledge, experience, and a broad network of professional contacts in the nation&#39;s capitol. To learn more about the Washington Scholars Fellowship 
			Program please follow this link: <a href = "http://www.washingtonscholars.org/">http://www.washingtonscholars.org/</a>
