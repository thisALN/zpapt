				The chapter began as a local fraternity named Alpha Pi Tau in 1965 before fraternities were officially recognized at Virginia Tech. It wasn’t until 1975
				that the Alpha Pi chapter of Zeta Psi was officially chartered and has been growing ever since then. We recently celebrated our 40th anniversary as a 
				chapter of Zeta Psi and it is a testament to the strong brotherhood of our chapter.

				The national chapter was founded on June 1st, 1847 at New York University and is proud to hold numerous “firsts”. Zeta Psi was the first Fraternity to
				establish a chapter on the west coast of the United States, the first to establish a chapter in Canada, the first to have an active chapter at all Ivy 
				League schools simultaneously, and the first to establish a chapter outside of North America. In addition, Zeta Psi has had many notable alumni
				including: Henry Ford, the Chairman and CEO of Ford Motor Company; Joe Maddon, current manager of the Chicago Cubs; Ian Murray, co-founder
				and CEO of Vineyard Vines; Brian Sullivan, CNBC anchor from our chapter; as well as many current and former governors, senators, CEOs, 
				Olympians, NFL hall of famers, university presidents, Nobel Prize winners and many others. If you would like to learn more about our history
