				Philanthropy
				</h2>
				<p>
				Philanthropy is very important to our brothers, which is why our chapter decided to start Woofstock back in 2012 to benefit the
				local Humane Society of Montgomery County. Unlike many other fraternity&#39;s philanthropies, the supplies and money that we raise
				go right back to the dogs and cats in Montgomery County. Last year we raised over $2,000 and 2 truckloads worth of donations from
				our supply drives, percentage night, and benefit concert. If you are interested in learning more about the Humane Society of
				Montgomery County please visit the following link. <a href = "http://www.hsmcshelter.com/home.html">http://www.hsmcshelter.com/home.html</a>

				<p>
				In addition to our own philanthropy, we participate in many philanthropic events around the Virginia Tech campus such as the Big
				Event, Pi Beta Phi&#39;s Dodge the Arrow, Chi Omega&#39;s Wish Week, Tri Delt&#39;s DHOP, Sigma Kappa&#39;s Ultra Violet Nights, Alpha Delta Pi&#39;s
				Preppy Olympics as well as many others.

				In 2015, recent efforts to improve the chapter paid off when we were awarded with the Bronze Award for Outstanding Chapter of
				the Year during the Annual Convention in Las Vegas, NV.
